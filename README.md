🤖 Rule-Based-Chatbot-WebApp
This repository contains a rule-based chatbot built with Python and Flask, designed to provide conversational responses based on predefined rules and patterns. Featuring a user-friendly web interface with dark mode and interactive elements, this project showcases skills in web development, conversational AI, and user experience design.
📖 Overview
The Rule-Based Chatbot WebApp is a Python-based application that mimics human-like conversations by recognizing keywords and phrases (e.g., greetings like "hi" or conversational fillers like "hmm"). Built with Flask, the chatbot offers a responsive web interface with features like dark mode, an emoji button, and an info button for user guidance. The project demonstrates proficiency in building simple AI systems and web applications.
🎯 Features

Recognizes greetings ("hi," "hello," "hey") to initiate conversations.
Mimics conversational fillers ("ohh okay," "aahaan," "hmm") for engaging interactions.
User-friendly web interface with:
Dark mode for improved readability.
Emoji button for adding reactions.
Info button to provide chatbot guidance.


Rule-based logic for processing user inputs and generating responses.
Modular codebase for easy maintenance and customization.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
Flask: Lightweight framework for building the web application.
HTML/CSS: For front-end UI (assumed in templates and static folders).
JavaScript: For interactive UI elements like emoji and info buttons (assumed).
Git: Version control with .gitignore for clean repository management.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Git

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/RachitNigam19/Rule-Based-Chatbot-WebApp.git
cd Rule-Based-Chatbot-WebApp


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: If requirements.txt is not present, install Flask manually: pip install flask)

Usage

Run the Flask application locally:python chatbot_logic.py


Access the app at http://localhost:5000.


Interact with the chatbot by entering greetings or conversational phrases.
Use the web interface features (e.g., dark mode, emoji button) to enhance the experience.
